The next function, `updateDirection`, is very simple although it is
rather long. This is perhaps the only time where I'd recommend a
copy-paste instead of writing the code for yourself!

```cpp
void Map::updateDirection(TileType tileType)
{
    for(int y = 0; y < this->height; ++y)
    {
        for(int x = 0; x < this->width; ++x)
        {
            int pos = y*this->width+x;

            if(this->tiles[pos].tileType != tileType) continue;

            bool adjacentTiles[3][3] = {{0,0,0},{0,0,0},{0,0,0}};

            /* Check for adjacent tiles of the same type */
            if(x > 0 && y > 0)
                adjacentTiles[0][0] = (this->tiles[(y-1)*this->width+(x-1)].tileType == tileType);
            if(y > 0)
                adjacentTiles[0][1] = (this->tiles[(y-1)*this->width+(x  )].tileType == tileType);
            if(x < this->width-1 && y > 0)
                adjacentTiles[0][2] = (this->tiles[(y-1)*this->width+(x+1)].tileType == tileType);
            if(x > 0)
                adjacentTiles[1][0] = (this->tiles[(y  )*this->width+(x-1)].tileType == tileType);
            if(x < width-1)
                adjacentTiles[1][2] = (this->tiles[(y  )*this->width+(x+1)].tileType == tileType);
            if(x > 0 && y < this->height-1)
                adjacentTiles[2][0] = (this->tiles[(y+1)*this->width+(x-1)].tileType == tileType);
            if(y < this->height-1)
                adjacentTiles[2][1] = (this->tiles[(y+1)*this->width+(x  )].tileType == tileType);
            if(x < this->width-1 && y < this->height-1)
                adjacentTiles[2][2] = (this->tiles[(y+1)*this->width+(x+1)].tileType == tileType);

            /* Change the tile variant depending on the tile position */
            if(adjacentTiles[1][0] && adjacentTiles[1][2] && adjacentTiles[0][1] && adjacentTiles[2][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 2;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][0] && adjacentTiles[1][2] && adjacentTiles[0][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 7;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][0] && adjacentTiles[1][2] && adjacentTiles[2][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 8;
            else if(adjacentTiles[0][1] && adjacentTiles[2][1] && adjacentTiles[1][0])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 9;
            else if(adjacentTiles[0][1] && adjacentTiles[2][1] && adjacentTiles[1][2])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 10;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][0] && adjacentTiles[1][2])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 0;
            else if(adjacentTiles[0][1] && adjacentTiles[2][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 1;
            else if(adjacentTiles[2][1] && adjacentTiles[1][0])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 3;
            else if(adjacentTiles[0][1] && adjacentTiles[1][2])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 4;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][0] && adjacentTiles[0][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 5;
            else if(adjacentTiles[2][1] && adjacentTiles[1][2])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 6;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][0])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 0;
            else if(adjacentTiles[1][2])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 0;
            else if(adjacentTiles[0][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 1;
            else if(adjacentTiles[2][1])
                this->tiles[pos].tileVariant = 1;
        }
    }

    return;
}
```

As an overview, `updateDirection` iterates over every `Tile`. It then
builds an array of all the adjacent tiles, setting each element to
`true` if the `Tile` is of the same type as the centre `Tile`, and
`false` otherwise. Finally the `adjacentTiles` array is checked to see
the configuration of its `true`/`false` values, and the `tileVariant` of
the `Tile` is set accordingly. The order of the checks here is
important, as we are only checking for `true` elements and not `false`;
some combinations exist that would override others. For example, a
crossroads would appear as a corner tile if you checked for the corner
tile first. You could make this more programmer friendly by defining
`const` values for each direction combination, but it's just as simple
to refer to this image

![The highlighted edges are the ones where tiles are adjacent](/tutorial/img/06-01.png)

We now go from long and boring to short and interesting, with our
`depthfirstsearch` function. If you've used such an algorithm before you
can skip over this bit, but at least look at the code! If not, it's time
to explain a 'proper' algorithm. As we discussed a while back, we want
our industrial zones to dig material from the ground and then ship it to
commercial zones where it can be sold. They can't just send the material
to any zone though, they would need to be connected using roads (or
another zone). To do this we need to check if there is a path that only
goes through adjacent zones or roads and that takes us from the
industrial zone at the start to some other commercial zone. We use
something called a depth-first search to do this, that starts at a
`Tile` and checks if we can go through it or not. If we can, it branches
off to every adjacent `Tile`, checking again, before branching off, then
checking again... it then stops when we find the `Tile` we can stop at.
This is fine, but it isn't very efficient; we will have to check if
every industrial zone is connected to every commercial zone! That's
going to be extremely slow, and what's more we have to do it every new
game day. One way of improving this would be to simply use a more
efficient pathfinding algorithm, such as A*. That doesn't fix our
problem though, we've still got far too many pairs of zones to check,
especially in a large city.

Instead what we do is split the `Map` into regions (using the `regions`
array from before). Each `Tile` will be labelled depending on what
region it is in, where two `Tile`s are in the same region if there is a
path (through zones or roads) between them. If we find all of those
paths, we can just check which region each `Tile` is in instead of
trying to find a path between them each time. (We don't care what the
path is after all, only that one exists!) What's more, we only have to
update the regions when those paths change; if a `Tile` is created or
destroyed. That's exactly what `depthfirstsearch` and
`findConnectingRegions` do, they split the `Map` into those regions.

![Our region creating search in action; different colours are different
    regions](06-02.gif)

```cpp
void Map::depthfirstsearch(std::vector<TileType>& whitelist,
    sf::Vector2i pos, int label, int regionType=0)
{
    if(pos.x < 0 || pos.x >= this->width) return;
    if(pos.y < 0 || pos.y >= this->height) return;
    if(this->tiles[pos.y*this->width+pos.x].regions[regionType] != 0) return;
    bool found = false;
    for(auto type : whitelist)
    {
        if(type == this->tiles[pos.y*this->width+pos.x].tileType)
        {
            found = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if(!found) return;

    this->tiles[pos.y*this->width+pos.x].regions[regionType] = label;

    depthfirstsearch(whitelist, pos + sf::Vector2i(-1,  0), label, regionType);
    depthfirstsearch(whitelist, pos + sf::Vector2i(0 ,  1), label, regionType);
    depthfirstsearch(whitelist, pos + sf::Vector2i(1 ,  0), label, regionType);
    depthfirstsearch(whitelist, pos + sf::Vector2i(0 , -1), label, regionType);

    return;
}
```

Let's examine how this function works. First we check to see if the
supplied position is out of bounds of the `Map`. If it is, we `return`.
We then check to see if the `Tile` has already received a region and
hence has already been visited by the function. If it has, we `return`,
as we don't want to go over the same `Tile` twice. If we did the
function would never finish! We then check to see if the `Tile`'s
`tileType` is present in `whitelist`. If it isn't, once again we
`return`, otherwise we assign the `Tile` a region and call
`depthfirstsearch` again 4 times, once for each adjacent tile. Such a
function that calls itself is called recursive, and so this is a
recursive implementation of the depth-first search algorithm; there is
also an iterative version, which uses `for` loops, but I find this one
is much easier to understand! If you've been paying attention though,
you'll have noticed that `depthfirstsearch` is a `private` function! We
will use `findConnectingRegions` to actually start the search.

```cpp
void Map::findConnectedRegions(std::vector<TileType> whitelist, int regionType=0)
{
    int regions = 1;

    for(auto& tile : this->tiles) tile.regions[regionType] = 0;

    for(int y = 0; y < this->height; ++y)
    {
        for(int x = 0; x < this->width; ++x)
        {
            bool found = false;
            for(auto type : whitelist)
            {
                if(type == this->tiles[y*this->width+x].tileType)
                {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(this->tiles[y*this->width+x].regions[regionType] == 0 && found)
            {
                depthfirstsearch(whitelist, sf::Vector2i(x, y), regions++, regionType);
            }
        }
    }
    this->numRegions[regionType] = regions;
}
```

Upon calling the function we clear each `Tile`'s region to 0, and then
we iterate over every `Tile`. Once again we check to see if the
`tileType` is in the `whitelist`, and if it is and the `Tile` has not
yet been assigned a region we call `depthfirstsearch` on that tile.
Since `depthfirstsearch` only continues through `whitelist`ed `Tile`s,
every call of `depthfirstsearch` will be for a new region! Therefore we
just increment the `regions` variable after every call, and each
isolated block of tiles will be assigned a different region.

All that's left is to try it out! Create a new `Map` in
`GameStateEditor`, then either `load` it or fill it with random tiles
using a `for` loop inside the constructor. Add a `map.draw` call in
`draw` after we draw the background (note it's `map.draw(window, dt)`
not `window.draw(map)`), then compile and run! Hopefully you should see
a lovely, animated world.

![Beautiful!](/tutorial/img/06-03.png)

Now we've actually got some interesting things on the screen this
program is starting to look like a game! It's still completely
noninteractive though, so let's change that by adding the ability to pan
(move around) and zoom the camera. For this we will use a state variable
(not a `GameState`, just a variable that will keep track of what the
player is doing) called `actionState`. First then, let's add this and
some other variables to `GameStateEditor`

```cpp
#include <SFML/System.hpp>

#include "game_state.hpp"
#include "map.hpp"

enum class ActionState { NONE, PANNING };

class GameStateEditor : public GameState
{
    private:

    ActionState actionState;

    sf::View gameView;
    sf::View guiView;

    Map map;

    sf::Vector2i panningAnchor;
    float zoomLevel;
```

We've used an `enum class` definition again to create the `ActionState`
type; if `actionState == ActionState::PANNING` then the player is
panning the camera, otherwise they are not. We don't need an entry for
zooming, as zooming is not a continuous process and will only happen
upon each turn of the mouse wheel. We then have the `panningAnchor`
variable which will keep track of where we started panning. Upon
pressing the middle mouse button, `panningAnchor` will record the mouse
position. Then as the mouse moves away from the `panningAnchor` and the
middle mouse button is still held down, the world will move too.
`zoomLevel` records how far zoomed in we are, and is increased and
decreased as the player scrolls the mouse wheel forwards and backwards.
We will double and halve `zoomLevel` in order to keep the world at a
nice scale factor (computers love powers of 2). First let's initialise
some variable inside of the `GameStateEditor` constructor

```cpp
GameStateEditor::GameStateEditor(Game* game)
{
    this->game = game;
    sf::Vector2f pos = sf::Vector2f(this->game->window.getSize());
    this->guiView.setSize(pos);
    this->gameView.setSize(pos);
    pos *= 0.5f;
    this->guiView.setCenter(pos);
    this->gameView.setCenter(pos);

    map = Map("city_map.dat", 64, 64, game->tileAtlas);

    this->zoomLevel = 1.0f;

    /* Centre the camera on the map */
    sf::Vector2f centre(this->map.width, this->map.height*0.5);
    centre *= float(this->map.tileSize);
    gameView.setCenter(centre);

    this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
}
```

The new parts start below the `map` assignment; we initialise
`zoomLevel`, set the `actionState`, and whilst we're here we also centre
the camera on the `Map`. Forgive the British/American mix, I can't seem
to default to "center"... We also need to update the `draw` function so
that is uses the correct views. So far they've been the same and it
hasn't mattered, but now that we are moving `gameView` around and
zooming it in and out we need to make the distinction.

```cpp
void GameStateEditor::draw(const float dt)
{
    this->game->window.clear(sf::Color::Black);

    this->game->window.setView(this->guiView);
    this->game->window.draw(this->game->background);

    this->game->window.setView(this->gameView);
    map.draw(this->game->window, dt);

    return;
}
```

We want the background to always be drawn in the same place, so we draw
it on `guiView`, but the world is part of the game and so should be
drawn to `gameView`. If you compile the code now you should see a nicely
centred `Map` being displayed in front of `background`, which should
expand as you resize the window whilst the `Map` stays in the same
(relative) place.

![All nice and neat](/tutorial/img/06-04.png)

Now we can add the actual panning and zooming code. This code should be
placed as events inside of the `handleInput` function. The new events
are

```cpp
case sf::Event::MouseMoved:
{
    /* Pan the camera */
    if(this->actionState == ActionState::PANNING)
    {
        sf::Vector2f pos = sf::Vector2f(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window) - this->panningAnchor);
        gameView.move(-1.0f * pos * this->zoomLevel);
        panningAnchor = sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window);
    }
    break;
}
case sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed:
{
    /* Start panning */
    if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Middle)
    {
        if(this->actionState != ActionState::PANNING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::PANNING;
            this->panningAnchor = sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window);
        }
    }
    break;
}
case sf::Event::MouseButtonReleased:
{
    /* Stop panning */
    if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Middle)
    {
        this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
    }
    break;
}
/* Zoom the view */
case sf::Event::MouseWheelMoved:
{
    if(event.mouseWheel.delta < 0)
    {
        gameView.zoom(2.0f);
        zoomLevel *= 2.0f;
    }
    else
    {
        gameView.zoom(0.5f);
        zoomLevel *= 0.5f;
    }
    break;
}
```

When the middle mouse button is pressed and the player is not already
panning the camera (this is why we created `actionState`) we set the
`panningAnchor` to the position of the mouse. This is a *screen*
position, and has nothing to do with the views we created. We also set
`actionState` so that the program knows that the player is panning. When
the middle mouse button is released, we set the `actionState` to
`ActionState::NONE` so that the player is not panning anymore. If the
mouse moves whilst the player is panning then we get the new position of
the mouse and subtract the old position (the `panningAnchor`) from it.
Since both positions are coordinates, we can interpet this as
calculating the (mathematical) vector from the anchor to the mouse. We
then move the `gameView` in the direction that vector points.

To get a nice pan, we want the `Map` to move exactly in sync with the
mouse, so whatever pixel was underneath the mouse when the panning
started will remain beneath the mouse throughout the pan. To achieve
this we first reverse the direction of motion; if you stop to think
about it, moving a camera to the right is the same as moving everything
else to the left, but we want the view to follow the mouse like a sheet
of paper or a physical map, and so we reverse this by multiply by -1. At
a 1:1 screen to `gameView` scale ratio (when `zoomLevel` is 1) the view
will follow the cursor perfectly. But if `zoomLevel` is 2 we have a 1:2
ratio and so we have to multiply however much the mouse has moved by the
`zoomLevel` in order to get the ratio to 2:2 (which is the same as 1:1)
and make everything move in sync.

Finally, when the mouse wheel is scrolled up (negative `delta`) we zoom
the view by a factor of 2 and if the wheel is scrolled down we zoom the
view by a factor of 0.5. Much simpler! Although try compiling and
running the program, zooming in, and then resizing the window. See that
the zoom level resets? Well it doesn't actually, `zoomLevel` remains the
same and it's only the view that changes. This is obviously bad as
`zoomLevel` stops being in sync with the actual zoom! If you try panning
again you'll see how bad this is. We could fix this by just setting
`zoomLevel = 1.0f` when the player resizes the view, but it's better to
match the view with the `zoomLevel` instead of the other way around (it
prevents suddening zoom reset, which looks weird). The `zoom` call is
the new bit!

```cpp
/* Resize the window */
case sf::Event::Resized:
{
    gameView.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
    gameView.zoom(zoomLevel);
```

In the next tutorial we will add the ability to select tiles ready for
bulldozing or building.
