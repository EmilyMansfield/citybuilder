Simulation games, whilst not as action packed as FPSs or as emotive as
RPGs, are nonetheless a rather popular game genre. In this tutorial we
will develop a simple city simulation game, in which the player can
build houses and shops, lay roads, and generally maintain a population.
Since C++ (the language we'll be using) does not have native support for
graphics, we will use the [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org) library to
help create the game. It will be assumed that you have already installed
and set up SFML since this differs from platform to platform. See the
SFML website for details on how to do this. We will also be making use
of the `C++11` standard, and so make sure to enable the standard in your
compiler settings. Some older compilers (particularly Visual Studio) may
fail to compile the code even with the standard in use, but any
relatively new `g++` or MinGW compiler should work fine.

![What we'll be building](/tutoria/img/01-01.png)

Without further ado, let us begin! The core of almost any game is a
state manager, which unsurprisingly handles each of the states the game
can be in (e.g. the main menu, the game world, or the options menu). By
using a state manager we can nicely partition the game into these
states, instead of them just being nice logical blocks that remain soley
in our head. We will do this by creating a base `GameState` class which
our actual states will inherit from, and then creating a `Game` class
that will handle the changing of the states as well as storing the
information that is universal to (almost) every state. Creating a
`game_state.hpp` file then,

```cpp
#ifndef GAME_STATE_HPP
#define GAME_STATE_HPP

#include "game.hpp"

class GameState
{
    public:

    Game* game;

    virtual void draw(const float dt) = 0;
    virtual void update(const float dt) = 0;
    virtual void handleInput() = 0;
};

#endif /* GAME_STATE_HPP */
```

Ignoring the `#include` for a non-existent file (we'll fix that soon) we
have a small class definition. `game` is just a pointer back to the
state manager mentioned earlier, the functions are the interesting part.
They are all pure virtual functions and so are not defined within the
`GameState` class; they must be overridden by an inherited class in
order for them to be used. This is why we haven't defined or even
declared a constructor, the compiler wouldn't allow you to create an
instance of this class! The functions themselves are pretty
self-explanatory, they'll just be called by the state manager in order
to draw the state to the screen, update its logic, or handle its input.
We've used virtual functions like this so that the state manager does
not need to know what kind of state it has active, whatever kind it is
(main menu, game world, or otherwise) it will just call the same
functions.

Fixing that preemptive `#include`, create a `game.hpp` file.

```cpp
#ifndef GAME_HPP
#define GAME_HPP

#include <stack>
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

class GameState;

class Game
{
    public:

    std::stack<GameState*> states;

    sf::RenderWindow window;

    void pushState(GameState* state);
    void popState();
    void changeState(GameState* state);
    GameState* peekState();

    void gameLoop();

    Game();
    ~Game();
};

#endif /* GAME_HPP */
```

Here you might note that we have a bit of a loop with our class usage;
`Game` needs to know about `GameState`, but `GameState` needs to know
about `Game`! This would be a problem except for the little declaration
of the `GameState` class within the file, which tells `Game` about
`GameState`'s existence and allows us to include `game.hpp` in
`game_state.hpp` and fix the cycle! Looking in the class itself, there's
an `std::stack` data structure for storing the states and a few helper
functions to push and pop states to and from the stack. We then have the
`gameLoop` function, which will act much like `main` in our program.
This is purely a design decision, the game loop (which will call those
virtual functions) could be placed in `main` if you wanted. We then have
a simple constructor and destructor and finally, our first bit of SFML
code! Well, if you count a variable declaration of course... As the name
implies `window` is just the window that our game will be drawn in. With
the header file defined, let's create the source file for the `Game`
class, `game.cpp`

```cpp
#include <stack>

#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>
#include <SFML/System.hpp>

#include "game.hpp"
#include "game_state.hpp"

void Game::pushState(GameState* state)
{
    this->states.push(state);

    return;
}

void Game::popState()
{
    delete this->states.top();
    this->states.pop();

    return;
}

void Game::changeState(GameState* state)
{
    if(!this->states.empty())
        popState();
    pushState(state);

    return;
}

GameState* Game::peekState()
{
    if(this->states.empty()) return nullptr;
    return this->states.top();
}

void Game::gameLoop()
{
    sf::Clock clock;

    while(this->window.isOpen())
    {
        sf::Time elapsed = clock.restart();
        float dt = elapsed.asSeconds();

        if(peekState() == nullptr) continue;
        peekState()->handleInput();
        peekState()->update(dt);
        this->window.clear(sf::Color::Black);
        peekState()->draw(dt);
        this->window.display();
    }
}

Game::Game()
{
    this->window.create(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "City Builder");
    this->window.setFramerateLimit(60);
}

Game::~Game()
{
    while(!this->states.empty()) popState();
}
```

The state changing functions are all similar and simple; `pushState`
takes a pointer to a `GameState` (or one of its derived classes) and
pushes it on to the state stack, `popState` removes the top state from
the stack, `changeState` pops the previous state (if there was one) and
then pushes the new one on, and finally `peekState` returns a pointer to
whatever state is on top of the stack. But why do we use a stack, and
not just a `currentState` pointer, or similar? Well with a stack we can
add new states over the top of existing ones whilst still keeping track
of the old one, so we could add a pause game state which can be removed
when the game is unpaused, but which keeps the progress of the game
itself! Very handy, and I think worth the few extra lines it takes. The
destructor is also state related, and just deletes all the states on the
stack. Because of this, any states the state manager handles should be
allocated using `new`.

Finally we get into some 'proper' SFML code! In the constructor we
create a new render window (`sf::Window` cannot be drawn to, so we use
`sf::RenderWindow` instead) which is 800 pixels wide, 600 pixels high,
and is named "City Builder" (creativity is not my strong suit...). We
then cap the framerate to 60fps, to stop the game from running too fast
and eating too many cpu cycles!

Now let's look at the `gameloop` function. Our game will use a variable
timestep, here called `dt`, in order to make everything work at a smooth
rate. There are many different ways of controlling the speed of the
logic in a program, but since we want time to progress at the same rate
inside the game, regardless of the framerate, we will use this method.
(We could just assume that the game was running at 60fps, but that's not
a very safe assumption.) It works by starting a timer at the beginning
of each frame, and stopping it at the end, before storing the time
elapsed inside a timestep variable. This is then passed to any functions
that need to know the speed of the game. So if we want a ball to move at
100 pixels per second, and the frame took 0.1 seconds, then the ball
needs to move 10 pixels this frame. If the next frame takes twice as
long, the ball should move twice as far. `clock.restart` conveniently
returns the time since `clock` started, so we can combine the stopping
and starting into one line. We then use the virtual functions that we
defined earlier, making sure that we clear the screen before drawing the
new one and updating the window.

We have one more file to define for now, `main.cpp`! It'll be rather
simple (our simplest file even) since the heavy lifting is done by the
`Game` class

```cpp
#include "game.hpp"

int main()
{
    Game game;

    game.gameLoop();

    return 0;
}
```

Make the state manager, and then start the loop, trivial! We'll be back
later to add another line or too, but for now we've finished our state
manager! If you run the program an empty window should appear, but sadly
you'll have to close the poor thing using a task manager or equivalent,
hitting close will do nothing until we actually create a state!
