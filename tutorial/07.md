With that all done we can start to add the ability to change the `Map`
by bulldozing tiles and placing new ones. For this to work we'd need a
way for the player to select the tiles to be changed. For this we will
use an `std::vector` like `tiles`, but it will store `int`s instead. The
player will left click and drag to select the tiles, and when they
release the left mouse button the selection will be replaced with the
new tiles. First then, we'll need to create this `std::vector`. Whilst
it is only relevant to the `GameStateEditor` class, we will place it in
`Map` instead, as it's far easier to manage there.

```cpp
/* 0 = Deselected, 1 = Selected, 2 = Invalid */
std::vector<char> selected;
unsigned int numSelected;

/* Select the tiles within the bounds */
void select(sf::Vector2i start, sf::Vector2i end, std::vector<TileType> blacklist);

/* Deselect all tiles */
void clearSelected();
```

We've used `char`s instead of `int`s to be more efficient but we'll
still interpret them as numbers. `numSelected` is, unsurprisingly, the
number of tiles that are currently selected (and are not invalid). We
have the extra invalid option (so sadly we can't use an
`std::vector<bool>`) for tiles that are within the selection area but
cannot be replaced by the tile we are planning on adding (no zones over
rivers, for example). We then have the `select` function that selects
all the tiles within the bounding rectangle of `start` and `end`, and
sets all the tiles within that rectangle that are in the `blacklist` to
invalid. Finally we have `clearSelected` to just deselect every tile.

Now we have to update the constructors

```cpp
/* Blank map constructor */
Map()
{
    this->numSelected = 0;
    this->tileSize = 8;
    this->width = 0;
    this->height = 0;
    this->numRegions[0] = 1;
}
/* Load map from file constructor */
Map(const std::string& filename, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
    std::map<std::string, Tile>& tileAtlas)
{
    this->numSelected = 0;
    this->tileSize = 8;
    load(filename, width, height, tileAtlas);
}
```

With the data structures and declarations set up, let's go to `map.cpp`
to write the function definitions for `select` and `clearSelected`

```cpp
void Map::clearSelected()
{
    for(auto& tile : this->selected) tile = 0;

    this->numSelected = 0;

    return;
}

void Map::select(sf::Vector2i start, sf::Vector2i end, std::vector<TileType> blacklist)
{
    /* Swap coordinates if necessary */
    if(end.y < start.y) std::swap(start.y, end.y);
    if(end.x < start.x) std::swap(start.x, end.x);

    /* Clamp in range */
    if(end.x >= this->width)		end.x = this->width - 1;
    else if(end.x < 0) 				end.x = 0;
    if(end.y >= this->height) 		end.y = this->height - 1;
    else if(end.y < 0) 				end.y = 0;
    if(start.x >= this->width) 		start.x = this->width - 1;
    else if(start.x < 0) 			start.x = 0;
    if (start.y >= this->height) 	start.y = this->height - 1;
    else if(start.y < 0) 			start.y = 0;

    for(int y = start.y; y <= end.y; ++y)
    {
        for(int x = start.x; x <= end.x; ++x)
        {
            /* Check if the tile type is in the blacklist. If it is, mark it as
             * invalid, otherwise select it */
            this->selected[y*this->width+x] = 1;
            ++this->numSelected;
            for(auto type : blacklist)
            {
                if(this->tiles[y*this->width+x].tileType == type)
                {
                    this->selected[y*this->width+x] = 2;
                    --this->numSelected;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return;
}
```

I don't think `clearSelected` requires explanation anymore, but `select`
deserves some. We first make sure that the bounding rectangle is
extending down and to the right (increasing in both axes) by using the
`std::swap` function (found in the `<algorithm>` header) to make sure
that the `start` coordinates are smaller than the `end` ones. We then
ensure that the bounding rectangle does not extend off the edges of the
map (this would cause a buffer overflow, which we certainly do not
want!), before starting at the top left of the rectangle and iterating
over every tile within it. To save us an `if` we just default to
selecting the tile, and then mark it as invalid if the tile's `tileType`
is in the `blacklist`. We have one more thing to in `map.cpp`; go to the
`load` function and construct `selected` (the last line is the new one)

```cpp
/* Load map from disk */
void Map::load(const std::string& filename, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
    std::map<std::string, Tile>& tileAtlas)
{
    std::ifstream inputFile;
    inputFile.open(filename, std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);

    this->width = width;
    this->height = height;

    for(int pos = 0; pos < this->width * this->height; ++pos)
    {
        this->resources.push_back(255);
        this->selected.push_back(0);
```

With the selection functions in place the player needs a way to use
them! As discussed before the left mouse button will control all of the
selecting. Obviously this will be done in the `GameStateEditor` class,
so let's go to `game_state_editor.hpp` and add a few necessary variables

```cpp
enum class ActionState { NONE, PANNING, SELECTING };

class GameStateEditor : public GameState
{
    private:

    ActionState actionState;

    sf::View gameView;
    sf::View guiView;

    Map map;

    sf::Vector2i panningAnchor;
    float zoomLevel;

    sf::Vector2i selectionStart;
    sf::Vector2i selectionEnd;

    Tile* currentTile;
```

As you can see we've added another entry to the `ActionState` enum,
`ActionState::SELECTING`, and we've added two new `sf::Vector2i`s,
`selectionStart` and `selectionEnd`. These will be the `start` and `end`
arguments that we pass to `select`. We've also added a pointer to a
`Tile`. `currentTile` will point to whatever tile the player wants to
replace the selection with. Not forgetting to initialise them in the
constructor,

```cpp
    this->selectionStart = sf::Vector2i(0, 0);
    this->selectionEnd = sf::Vector2i(0, 0);

    this->currentTile = &this->game->tileAtlas.at("grass");
    this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
}
```

We'll let the player choose `currentTile` later, for now we'll just set
it to the `TileType::GRASS` tile. The selection code itself will be in
the `handleInput` function like before, which now looks like

```cpp
case sf::Event::MouseMoved:
{
    /* Pan the camera */
    if(this->actionState == ActionState::PANNING)
    {
        sf::Vector2f pos = sf::Vector2f(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window) - this->panningAnchor);
        gameView.move(-1.0f * pos * this->zoomLevel);
        panningAnchor = sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window);
    }
    /* Select tiles */
    else if(actionState == ActionState::SELECTING)
    {
        sf::Vector2f pos = this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window), this->gameView);
        selectionEnd.x = pos.y / (this->map.tileSize) + pos.x / (2*this->map.tileSize) - this->map.width * 0.5 - 0.5;
        selectionEnd.y = pos.y / (this->map.tileSize) - pos.x / (2*this->map.tileSize) + this->map.width * 0.5 + 0.5;

        this->map.clearSelected();
        if(this->currentTile->tileType == TileType::GRASS)
        {
            this->map.select(selectionStart, selectionEnd, {this->currentTile->tileType, TileType::WATER});
        }
        else
        {
            this->map.select(selectionStart, selectionEnd,
                {
                    this->currentTile->tileType,    TileType::FOREST,
                    TileType::WATER,                TileType::ROAD,
                    TileType::RESIDENTIAL,          TileType::COMMERCIAL,
                    TileType::INDUSTRIAL
                });
        }
    }
    break;
}
case sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed:
{
    /* Start panning */
    if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Middle)
    {
        if(this->actionState != ActionState::PANNING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::PANNING;
            this->panningAnchor = sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window);
        }
    }
    else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Left)
    {
        /* Select map tile */
        if(this->actionState != ActionState::SELECTING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::SELECTING;
            sf::Vector2f pos = this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window), this->gameView);
            selectionStart.x = pos.y / (this->map.tileSize) + pos.x / (2*this->map.tileSize) - this->map.width * 0.5 - 0.5;
            selectionStart.y = pos.y / (this->map.tileSize) - pos.x / (2*this->map.tileSize) + this->map.width * 0.5 + 0.5;
        }
    }
    else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Right)
    {
        /* Stop selecting */
        if(this->actionState == ActionState::SELECTING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
            this->map.clearSelected();
        }
    }
    break;
}
case sf::Event::MouseButtonReleased:
{
    /* Stop panning */
    if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Middle)
    {
        this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
    }
    /* Stop selecting */
    else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Left)
    {
        if(this->actionState == ActionState::SELECTING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
            this->map.clearSelected();
        }
    }
    break;
}
```

Examining what happens when the left mouse button is pressed, we see
that if the player is not already selecting tiles then `actionState` is
set accordingly and the position of the mouse in game world coordinates
is recorded. We then use a far fancier looking formula than before to
convert from the world coordinates to the `Map` coordinates. This is the
reverse of what we did previously (tile coordinates to screen
coordinates) and so a little bit of algebra can be used to rearrange the
old equation into these new ones. I encourage you to try it out for
yourself as sadly the derivation is too cumbersome to write in this
format! I'm not just being lazy, I promise...

When the mouse is moved and the player is selecting tiles we repeat the
same calculation on the new mouse position to compute the end point of
the rectangle. We then use the `select` function to select the tiles.
The `if` statement is there because the grass tile acts like a
bulldozer, replacing anything that isn't water with grass, but when
placing any other tile you are building and not demolishing, and so the
land must be free of other buildings first.

Hopefully this code should compile fine, and under the hood it should
work although the selection box will not be visible. To fix this we need
to go back into `map.cpp` (sorry, I was wrong when I said that was all!)
and alter the `draw` function. A simple and effective way of marking the
selection area is to simply darken all the tiles. We can do this using
`sf::Sprite`'s `setColor` function, which changes the overall colour of
the sprite using a colour multiply. The `sf::Color` constructor takes
`rgb` values from 0-255, or 0x0-0xff in hexadecimal

```cpp
/* Change the colour if the tile is selected */
if(this->selected[y*this->width+x])
    this->tiles[y*this->width+x].sprite.setColor(sf::Color(0x7d, 0x7d, 0x7d));
else
    this->tiles[y*this->width+x].sprite.setColor(sf::Color(0xff, 0xff, 0xff));

/* Draw the tile */
this->tiles[y*this->width+x].draw(window, dt);
```

If the `Tile` isn't selected we set it's colour to white (so that it is
unchanged) and if it is we halve its brightness. Now running the code
should allow you to draw lovely selection boxes! They might not do
anything, but at it's a step in the right direction.
