Now we'll look at the (rather long) `update` function. We'll split it
into several parts

```cpp
void City::update(float dt)
{
    double popTotal = 0;
    double commercialRevenue = 0;
    double industrialRevenue = 0;

    /* Update the game time */
    this->currentTime += dt;
    if(this->currentTime < this->timePerDay) return;
    ++day;
    this->currentTime = 0.0;
    if(day % 30 == 0)
    {
        this->funds += this->earnings;
        this->earnings = 0;
    }
    /* Run first pass of tile updates. Mostly handles pool distribution */
    for(int i = 0; i < this->map.tiles.size(); ++i)
    {
        Tile& tile = this->map.tiles[this->shuffledTiles[i]];

        if(tile.tileType == TileType::RESIDENTIAL)
        {
            /* Redistribute the pool and increase the population total by the tile's population */
            this->distributePool(this->populationPool, tile, this->birthRate - this->deathRate);

            popTotal += tile.population;
        }
        else if(tile.tileType == TileType::COMMERCIAL)
        {
            /* Hire people */
            if(rand() % 100 < 15 * (1.0-this->commercialTax))
                this->distributePool(this->employmentPool, tile, 0.00);
        }
        else if(tile.tileType == TileType::INDUSTRIAL)
        {
            /* Extract resources from the ground */
            if(this->map.resources[i] > 0 && rand() % 100 < this->population)
            {
                ++tile.production;
                --this->map.resources[i];
            }
            /* Hire people */
            if(rand() % 100 < 15 * (1.0-this->industrialTax))
                this->distributePool(this->employmentPool, tile, 0.0);
        }

        tile.update();
    }
```

Initially we move to the next day if enough time has passed, much like
how `AnimationHandler::update` works. If a month has passed then the
`earnings` are added to `funds` and the `earnings` reset to 0. The bulk
of the `update` function is a series of loops that iterate over every
`tile` in the `map` (using `shuffledTiles` of course). These loops must
be separate as the order in which various things happen is important.
First people attempt to move from the `populationPool` into the
residential zones, and the population of each zone is adjusted according
to the net birth rate. The commercial zones then attempt to hire people,
where they will hire more people the lower the `commercialTax` is.
Finally the industrial zones will attempt to hire people too, but will
also extract resources from the ground if any are left. (Remember the
`resources` variable in `Map`?) We then call `update` on the `tile` to
change its `tileVariant` if necessary (i.e. the population is full).

```cpp
    /* Run second pass. Mostly handles goods manufacture */
    for(int i = 0; i < this->map.tiles.size(); ++i)
    {
        Tile& tile = this->map.tiles[this->shuffledTiles[i]];

        if(tile.tileType == TileType::INDUSTRIAL)
        {
            int receivedResources = 0;
            /* Receive resources from smaller and connected zones */
            for(auto& tile2 : this->map.tiles)
            {
                if(tile2.regions[0] == tile.regions[0] && tile2.tileType == TileType::INDUSTRIAL)
                {
                    if(tile2.production > 0)
                    {
                        ++receivedResources;
                        --tile2.production;
                    }
                    if(receivedResources >= tile.tileVariant+1) break;
                }
            }
            /* Turn resources into goods */
            tile.storedGoods += (receivedResources+tile.production)*(tile.tileVariant+1);
        }
    }
```

In the second pass the industrial zones attempt to take any resources
from smaller zones that they are connected to via roads or zones (those
in the same region) before turning those `resource`s into `storedGoods`.
Each zone can only recieve 1 resource from every other tile and can only
recieve 1 more than its `tileVariant` in total resources. The larger the
`tileVariant` (and so the larger and more advanced the industrial zone)
the more goods it can produce per resource and the more resources it can
receive.

```cpp
    /* Run third pass. Mostly handles goods distribution */
    for(int i = 0; i < this->map.tiles.size(); ++i)
    {
        Tile& tile = this->map.tiles[this->shuffledTiles[i]];

        if(tile.tileType == TileType::COMMERCIAL)
        {
            int receivedGoods = 0;
            double maxCustomers = 0.0;
            for(auto& tile2 : this->map.tiles)
            {
                if(tile2.regions[0] == tile.regions[0] &&
                    tile2.tileType == TileType::INDUSTRIAL &&
                    tile2.storedGoods > 0)
                {
                    while(tile2.storedGoods > 0 && receivedGoods != tile.tileVariant+1)
                    {
                        --tile2.storedGoods;
                        ++receivedGoods;
                        industrialRevenue += 100 * (1.0-industrialTax);
                    }
                }
                else if(tile2.regions[0] == tile.regions[0] &&
                    tile2.tileType == TileType::RESIDENTIAL)
                {
                    maxCustomers += tile2.population;
                }
                if(receivedGoods == tile.tileVariant+1) break;
            }
            /* Calculate the overall revenue for the tile */
            tile.production = (receivedGoods*100.0 + rand() % 20) * (1.0-this->commercialTax);

            double revenue = tile.production * maxCustomers * tile.population / 100.0;
            commercialRevenue += revenue;
        }
    }
```

In the third and final pass the goods produced by the industrial zones
are distributed amongst the commercial zones which then sell the goods.
First, any goods in connected industrial zones are moved into the
commercial zone producing taxable income for the industrial zones. Any
connected residential regions increase the maximum number of customers
the commerical zone can recieve. We then calculate the revenue the
commercial zones generate from selling the goods.

```cpp
    /* Adjust population pool for births and deaths */
    this->populationPool = this->adjustPopulation(this->populationPool, this->birthRate - this->deathRate);
    popTotal += this->populationPool;

    /* Adjust the employment pool for the changing population */
    float newWorkers = (popTotal - this->population) * this->propCanWork;
    newWorkers *= newWorkers < 0 ? -1 : 1;
    this->employmentPool += newWorkers;
    this->employable += newWorkers;
    if(this->employmentPool < 0) this->employmentPool = 0;
    if(this->employable < 0) this->employable = 0;

    /* Update the city population */
    this->population = popTotal;

    /* Calculate city income from tax */
    this->earnings = (this->population - this->populationPool) * 15 * this->residentialTax;
    this->earnings += commercialRevenue * this->commercialTax;
    this->earnings += industrialRevenue * this->industrialTax;

    return;
}
```

In the last part of `update` we adjust the `populationPool` based on the
net birth rate, and we add new people to the `employmentPool` if the
total population is different from the population on the previous day.
This simulates citizens entering the job market, although of course if
the population decreases then the number of employable people will drop
too. Finally we tax all the income (as well as the residential zones)
and increase `earnings` by the total amount.

And with that the final class is completed! Now all that's left is to
incorporate this into `GameStateEditor` and put a `Gui` in that class
too. Firstly we'll replace the `map` variable in `GameStateEditor` with
a `City`, `city` instead. So now instead of `this->map.tileSize` calls
(for example) we will have `this->city.map.tileSize` calls. (Beware the
`mapPixelToCoords` function if you find and replace `map` with
`city.map`!) We'll also need to add a `guiSystem` variable like we did
in `GameStateStart`. Oh, and remember to include `<map>`, `<string`, and
`"gui.hpp"`!

Inside the constructor we should of course replace `map.load` with the
`City` equivalent,

```cpp
    this->city = City("city", this->game->tileSize, this->game->tileAtlas);
    this->city.shuffleTiles();
```

And we'll also need to add the `Gui` system. This one will be
considerably longer than in `GameStateStart`!

```cpp
/* Create gui elements */
this->guiSystem.emplace("rightClickMenu", Gui(sf::Vector2f(196, 16), 2, false, this->game->stylesheets.at("button"),
    {
        std::make_pair("Flatten $"          + this->game->tileAtlas["grass"].getCost(),         "grass"),
        std::make_pair("Forest $"           + this->game->tileAtlas["forest"].getCost(),        "forest" ),
        std::make_pair("Residential Zone $" + this->game->tileAtlas["residential"].getCost(),   "residential"),
        std::make_pair("Commercial Zone $"  + this->game->tileAtlas["commercial"].getCost(),    "commercial"),
        std::make_pair("Industrial Zone $"  + this->game->tileAtlas["industrial"].getCost(),    "industrial"),
        std::make_pair("Road $"             + this->game->tileAtlas["road"].getCost(),          "road")
    }));

this->guiSystem.emplace("selectionCostText", Gui(sf::Vector2f(196, 16), 0, false, this->game->stylesheets.at("text"),
    { std::make_pair("", "") }));

this->guiSystem.emplace("infoBar", Gui(sf::Vector2f(this->game->window.getSize().x / 5 , 16), 2, true, this->game->stylesheets.at("button"),
    {
        std::make_pair("time",          "time"),
        std::make_pair("funds",         "funds"),
        std::make_pair("population",    "population"),
        std::make_pair("employment",    "employment"),
        std::make_pair("current tile",  "tile")
    }));
this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setPosition(sf::Vector2f(0, this->game->window.getSize().y - 16));
this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").show();
```

The `"rightClickMenu"` will (as its name implies) be shown when the
player presses the right mouse button. It will list all of the possible
tiles that they can place along with their prices, and when a tile is
chosen `currentTile` will be set to that tile. Any time the player
selects tiles, from then on, will cause the selected tiles to be
replaced with `currentTile`. `"selectionCostText"` will be displayed
when the player is selecting tiles, and will tell them how much the
tiles they are placing will cost. It will go red if the player does not
have enough funds to place the tiles. Lastly `"infoBar"` will sit and
span the bottom of the screen, displaying the game day and other useful
information for the player. If we want it to display information we'll
have to update that information all the time, so we can put that code
inside of `update`

```cpp
void GameStateEditor::update(const float dt)
{
    this->city.update(dt);

    /* Update the info bar at the bottom of the screen */
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setEntryText(0, "Day: " + std::to_string(this->city.day));
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setEntryText(1, "$" + std::to_string(long(this->city.funds)));
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setEntryText(2, std::to_string(long(this->city.population)) + " (" + std::to_string(long(this->city.getHomeless())) + ")");
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setEntryText(3, std::to_string(long(this->city.employable)) + " (" + std::to_string(long(this->city.getUnemployed())) + ")");
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setEntryText(4, tileTypeToStr(currentTile->tileType));

    /* Highlight entries of the right click context menu */
    this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").highlight(this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getEntry(this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window), this->guiView)));

    return;
}
```

The first entry of the `"infobar"` will be the game day, the second the
`city`'s funds, the third the population (with the number of homeless in
parentheses), the fourth the number of employable people (with the
number left unemployed in parentheses), and the fifth the name of the
`currentTile`. We have to first typecast to a `long` so that we don't
get floating point populations appearing (we used a `double` for ease of
calculation but we truncate it here to print the 'real' value). With
`update` done let's make sure that the `Gui` is actually drawn to the
screen

```cpp
void GameStateEditor::draw(const float dt)
{
    this->game->window.clear(sf::Color::Black);

    this->game->window.setView(this->guiView);
    this->game->window.draw(this->game->background);

    this->game->window.setView(this->gameView);
    this->city.map.draw(this->game->window, dt);

    this->game->window.setView(this->guiView);
    for(auto gui : this->guiSystem) this->game->window.draw(gui.second);

    return;
}
```

First we switch to the `guiView` and then we draw each `Gui` in turn
like in `GameStateStart`. The `Gui` is of course drawn after the `city`,
otherwise the player wouldn't be able to see it! Finally we can add the
`Gui` code to `handleInput`. Before we get to the `switch` statement it
would be sensible to save ourselves some writing and create `gamePos`
and `guiPos` variables that record the position of the mouse in
`gameView` and `guiView` coordinates

```cpp
void GameStateEditor::handleInput()
{
    sf::Event event;

    sf::Vector2f guiPos = this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window), this->guiView);
    sf::Vector2f gamePos = this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Mouse::getPosition(this->game->window), this->gameView);

    while(this->game->window.pollEvent(event))
```

Inside of the `MouseMoved` event we'll add the code to display the
`"selectionCostText"` `Gui`

```cpp
        else
        {
            this->city.map.select(selectionStart, selectionEnd,
                {
                    this->currentTile->tileType,    TileType::FOREST,
                    TileType::WATER,                TileType::ROAD,
                    TileType::RESIDENTIAL,          TileType::COMMERCIAL,
                    TileType::INDUSTRIAL
                });
        }

        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").setEntryText(0, "$" +
        std::to_string(this->currentTile->cost * this->city.map.numSelected));

        if(this->city.funds <= this->city.map.numSelected * this->currentTile->cost)
            this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").highlight(0);
        else
            this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").highlight(-1);
        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").setPosition(guiPos + sf::Vector2f(16, -16));
        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").show();
    }
    /* Highlight entries of the right click context menu */
    this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").highlight(this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getEntry(guiPos));
    break;
}
```

The total cost is of course the cost per tile multiplied by the number
of selected tiles. If the city does not has enough `funds` we highlight
the text, making it red. We then position the text to the bottom right
of the cursors and `show` it. We also `highlight` the entry of the
`"rightClickMenu"` that the player is hovering over. For the
`MouseButtonPressed` event, we hide the `Gui` when the middle mouse
button is pressed

```cpp
case sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed:
{
    /* Start panning */
    if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Middle)
    {
        this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").hide();
        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").hide();
```

When the left mouse button is pressed we select a tile from the
`"rightClickMenu"` if it is visible, or we start selecting tiles if it
isn't

```cpp
else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Left)
{
    /* Select a context menu entry */
    if(this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").visible == true)
    {
        std::string msg = this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").activate(guiPos);
        if(msg != "null") this->currentTile = &this->game->tileAtlas.at(msg);

        this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").hide();
    }
    /* Select map tile */
    else
    {
        /* Select map tile */
        if(this->actionState != ActionState::SELECTING)
        {
            this->actionState = ActionState::SELECTING;
            selectionStart.x = gamePos.y / (this->city.map.tileSize)
                + gamePos.x / (2*this->city.map.tileSize) - this->city.map.width * 0.5 - 0.5;
            selectionStart.y = gamePos.y / (this->city.map.tileSize)
                - gamePos.x / (2*this->city.map.tileSize) + this->city.map.width * 0.5 + 0.5;
        }
    }
}
```

When we created the `"rightClickMenu"` we set the `message`s to be equal
to the name of the tile in the `tileAtlas`, and so we can easily set
`currentTile` to the one clicked. When an entry is selected we `hide`
the menu. Finally, in the `MouseButtonPressed` event we handle what
happens when the right mouse button is pressed

```cpp
else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Right)
{
    /* Stop selecting */
    if(this->actionState == ActionState::SELECTING)
    {
        this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").hide();
        this->city.map.clearSelected();
    }
    else
    {
        /* Open the tile select menu */
        sf::Vector2f pos = guiPos;

        if(pos.x > this->game->window.getSize().x - this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getSize().x)
        {
            pos -= sf::Vector2f(this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getSize().x, 0);
        }
        if(pos.y > this->game->window.getSize().y - this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getSize().y)
        {
            pos -= sf::Vector2f(0, this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").getSize().y);
        }
        this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").setPosition(pos);
        this->guiSystem.at("rightClickMenu").show();
    }
}
break;
```

As before we stop selecting if the right mouse button is pressed, but we
also make sure that we hide the `"selectionCostText"`. If the player
isn't selecting then we open the `"rightClickMenu"`. The `if` statements
make sure that the `Gui` is not opened in a position so as to go off the
edge of the screen; it will always open with a corner on the mouse
cursor, but which corner depends on where the mouse is when the button
is pressed. We then set the position of the `Gui` before `show`ing it.

Next we'll add the code to change the selected tiles. When the left
mouse button is released

```cpp
/* Stop selecting */
else if(event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Left)
{
    if(this->actionState == ActionState::SELECTING)
    {
        /* Replace tiles if enough funds and a tile is selected */
        if(this->currentTile != nullptr)
        {
            unsigned int cost = this->currentTile->cost * this->city.map.numSelected;
            if(this->city.funds >= cost)
            {
                this->city.bulldoze(*this->currentTile);
                this->city.funds -= this->currentTile->cost * this->city.map.numSelected;
                this->city.tileChanged();
            }
        }
        this->guiSystem.at("selectionCostText").hide();
        this->actionState = ActionState::NONE;
        this->city.map.clearSelected();
    }
}
```

Now as well as clearing the selection we hide the `"selectionCostText"`
and replace the selected tiles if the `city` has enough `funds` to do
so. We also call `tileChanged` to update the regions and roads.

Lastly we need to readjust the dimensions and position of the
`"infobar"` when the screen is resized

```cpp
/* Resize the window */
case sf::Event::Resized:
{
    gameView.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
    gameView.zoom(zoomLevel);
    guiView.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setDimensions(sf::Vector2f(event.size.width / this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").entries.size(), 16));
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").setPosition(this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Vector2i(0, event.size.height - 16), this->guiView));
    this->guiSystem.at("infoBar").show();
    this->game->background.setPosition(this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Vector2i(0, 0), this->guiView));
    this->game->background.setScale(
        float(event.size.width) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().x),
        float(event.size.height) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().y));
    break;
}
```

This is just the same code as we had in the constructor, but placed in
the `resize` function instead.

Phew, that was a lot of code! Try compiling and playing the game,
hopefully it does everything it's supposed to... I hope you enjoyed this
adventure into SFML, there's still a lot you can do with this game!
Perhaps add some new power station and pylon tiles and create an
electricity system (add another region to help distribute the
electricity) or make the zones demand water. You could also add some
nice background music (use the [`sf::Music`
class](http://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.1/group__audio.php)) or
add the option to create a new game instead of just continuing from an
existing one. Above all, enjoy yourself whilst you do it, and happy
programming!
