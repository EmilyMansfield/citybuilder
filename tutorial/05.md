With the `Tile` class now in place we can put them to use by combining
them into a `Map`. The `Map` class will contain a 2D array of `Tile`s as
well as a bunch of helper variables and functions for altering the
array. This will be our largest class yet (definition-wise, there aren't
too many declarations) as some of the functions are complicated. But
anyway, let's examine `map.hpp`

```cpp
#ifndef MAP_HPP
#define MAP_HPP

#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <vector>

#include "tile.hpp"

class Map
{
    private:

    void depthfirstsearch(std::vector<TileType>& whitelist,
        sf::Vector2i pos, int label, int type);

    public:

    unsigned int width;
    unsigned int height;

    std::vector<Tile> tiles;

    /* Resource map */
    std::vector<int> resources;

    unsigned int tileSize;

    unsigned int numSelected;

    unsigned int numRegions[1];

    /* Load map from disk */
    void load(const std::string& filename, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
        std::map<std::string, Tile>& tileAtlas);

    /* Save map to disk */
    void save(const std::string& filename);

    /* Draw the map */
    void draw(sf::RenderWindow& window, float dt);

    /* Checks if one position in the map is connected to another by
     * only traversing tiles in the whitelist */
    void findConnectedRegions(std::vector<TileType> whitelist, int type);

    /* Update the direction of directional tiles so that they face the correct
     * way. Used to orient roads, pylons, rivers etc */
    void updateDirection(TileType tileType);

    /* Blank map constructor */
    Map()
    {
        this->tileSize = 8;
        this->width = 0;
        this->height = 0;
        this->numRegions[0] = 1;
    }
    /* Load map from file constructor */
    Map(const std::string& filename, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
        std::map<std::string, Tile>& tileAtlas)
    {
        this->tileSize = 8;
        load(filename, width, height, tileAtlas);
    }
};

#endif /* MAP_HPP */
```

The `width` and `height` values are just the dimensions of the map,
which we have to remember because we aren't using a 2D array to contain
the tiles (I'm sorry, I lied); we're using a single `std::vector` and
just pretending that it's 2 dimensional. This makes it much simpler (and
more efficient) to iterate through when the position of the tile is not
needed, and it isn't very complicated when the position is needed
either. The `resources` `std::vector` will be used later by the
industrial zone tiles in order to produce their goods. Each tile will
have a limited amount of resources that the zone can extract, which is
what that array manages. Zones will also buy goods from other (smaller)
zones that do have resources, and so industrial zones will not simply
accelerate their production and then suddenly become useless. But that's
all for another tutorial! Right now we have a few simple variables, and
then finally some functions. We will use a custom binary format to load
and save the maps, which we'll examine when we define the functions.
Then there's the now familiar `draw` function, and some rather simple
constructors.

There's three functions that we haven't discussed;
`findConnectingRegions`, `depthfirstsearch`, and `updateDirection`.
`updateDirection` is simple (if tedious to implement) and iterates over
each `Tile` in the `Map`, changing their `tileVariant` so as to change
their animation and orient (if they have a correctly created texture)
them in the correct direction. The other two functions will be used to
split the `Map` into different regions, labelling them according to what
region they fall in. The `whitelist` argument is simply an `std::vector`
containing all the different `TileType`s that can make up the region. So
if you wanted a "greenery" region you might pass `TileType::GRASS` and
`TileType::FOREST` as arguments. `type` is the index of the `regions`
array in the `Tile` class that the region information should be stored
in. Currently we only have one possible region, but as mentioned above
more will be added later.

Now let's begin creating `map.cpp`

```cpp
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <fstream>

#include "map.hpp"
#include "tile.hpp"

/* Load map from disk */
void Map::load(const std::string& filename, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
    std::map<std::string, Tile>& tileAtlas)
{
    std::ifstream inputFile;
    inputFile.open(filename, std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);

    this->width = width;
    this->height = height;

    for(int pos = 0; pos < this->width * this->height; ++pos)
    {
        this->resources.push_back(255);

        TileType tileType;
        inputFile.read((char*)&tileType, sizeof(int));
        switch(tileType)
        {
            default:
            case TileType::VOID:
            case TileType::GRASS:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("grass"));
                break;
            case TileType::FOREST:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("forest"));
                break;
            case TileType::WATER:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("water"));
                break;
            case TileType::RESIDENTIAL:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("residential"));
                break;
            case TileType::COMMERCIAL:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("commercial"));
                break;
            case TileType::INDUSTRIAL:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("industrial"));
                break;
            case TileType::ROAD:
                this->tiles.push_back(tileAtlas.at("road"));
                break;
        }
        Tile& tile = this->tiles.back();
        inputFile.read((char*)&tile.tileVariant, sizeof(int));
        inputFile.read((char*)&tile.regions, sizeof(int)*1);
        inputFile.read((char*)&tile.population, sizeof(double));
        inputFile.read((char*)&tile.storedGoods, sizeof(float));
    }

    inputFile.close();

    return;
}
```

First we open a binary `std::ifstream` for the file specified. If you
are not familiar with `std::ifstream`, it is the C++ way of reading from
files. It inherits from the same class `std::cin` does (both are input
streams) and so has a very similar interface, although we won't be using
that here as we are dealing with binary files, not text files. Instead
we will use the `read` member function. Once we've opened the stream we
set `width` and `height` and then we loop enough times to read every
`Tile` from the stream, `read`ing the data upon each loop. `read`
requires a `char*` as the first argument, which can be interpreted as a
pointer to the start of an array of individual bytes (a `char` is the
size of a byte). The second argument is the number of bytes to read. If
we pass a pointer to the variable we want to read and pretend it's a
`char*` pointer by using a cast, `read` will fill the variable with the
data we want. We repeat this for all the variables we require. Note that
in our first `read` call we are also pretending that `tileType` is of
type `int` and not an `enum`; this is valid, as `enum`s are (kind of)
the same as `int`s, just referred to differently.

```cpp
void Map::save(const std::string& filename)
{
    std::ofstream outputFile;
    outputFile.open(filename, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);

    for(auto tile : this->tiles)
    {
        outputFile.write((char*)&tile.tileType, sizeof(int));
        outputFile.write((char*)&tile.tileVariant, sizeof(int));
        outputFile.write((char*)&tile.regions, sizeof(int)*3);
        outputFile.write((char*)&tile.population, sizeof(double));
        outputFile.write((char*)&tile.storedGoods, sizeof(float));
    }

    outputFile.close();

    return;
}
```

As you might expect, `save` is `load` in reverse. Well almost, we're
still processing the file in the same direction, so mostly we just
replace the `read`s with `write`s! And we replace the `std::ifstream`
with an `std::ofstream` of course. We then have a `for` loop, although
in a form you won't be familiar with unless you've seen some `c++11`; it
says "for each `tile` in `this->tiles`, do the following" The `auto`
keyword is another `c++11` feature, and can be used instead of the
variable's type if the type is obvious. 'auto' is far easier to write
than `std::vector<Tile>::iterator`, and without `c++11` the loop would
look far worse.

```cpp
void Map::draw(sf::RenderWindow& window, float dt)
{
    for(int y = 0; y < this->height; ++y)
    {
        for(int x = 0; x < this->width; ++x)
        {
            /* Set the position of the tile in the 2d world */
            sf::Vector2f pos;
            pos.x = (x - y) * this->tileSize + this->width * this->tileSize;
            pos.y = (x + y) * this->tileSize * 0.5;
            this->tiles[y*this->width+x].sprite.setPosition(pos);

            /* Draw the tile */
            this->tiles[y*this->width+x].draw(window, dt);
        }
    }
    return;
}
```

With the saving and loading functions done, we can write the code to
draw the `Map`. For this we need to know the coordinates of the `Tile`,
and so we use some normal nested `for` loops (`y` before `x` so we
iterate horizontally first, and then vertically). We then have some
formulae, seemingly conjured out of thin air, that convert the `Map`
coordinates `(x,y)` to world coordinates that we can use to draw each
`Tile` to the screen. They aren't conjured from thin air however, and
are created with just a small amount of reasoning!

![An isometric grid, for your convenience](/tutorial/img/05-01.png)

Consider an isometric grid, where the very top point has coordinates
`(0, 0)`, the `x` axis extends along the right edge and the `y` axis
extends along the left edge. If we increase `x` by 1, then `pos.x` will
increase by `tileSize` (remember `tileSize` is half the width, or the
height, of each sprite) and `pos.y` will increase by `tileSize * 0.5`.

```cpp
pos.x = x * this->tileSize;
pos.y = x * this->tileSize * 0.5;
```

If we increase `y` by 1, then `pos.x` will decrease by `tileSize`
(follow along the grid lines) and `pos.y` will increase by `tileSize *
0.5`.

```cpp
pos.x = x * this->tileSize - y * this->tileSize;
pos.y = x * this->tileSize * 0.5 + y * this->tileSize * 0.5;
```

With a tiny bit of algebra we get

```cpp
pos.x = (x - y) * this->tileSize;
pos.y = (x + y) * this->tileSize * 0.5;
```

The way we've set up our coordinates means that all sprites to the left
will have negative world coordinates. We don't want that, so we shift
the world coordinates to the right by half the width of the `Map` (in
pixels). Once we've converted to the world coordinates, we set the
position of the `Tile`'s sprite and then draw it. Because we're using a
1D `std::vector` instead of a 2D array, we have to convert our `(x,y)`
coordinates to a single value by using `index = y * this->width + x`.

That's all for now, in the next tutorial we will complete the
definitions of the `Map` member functions!
