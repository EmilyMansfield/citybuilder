Now that we can change the state of the game we need a state to change
to! Our game will use two states in this tutorial, `GameStateStart` and
`GameStateEditor`. The first will be the main game menu and the second
will be the game itself. For now the class definitions of each will be
almost identical, but that will change soon. Both of these states will
inherit from the base `GameState` class, and should be put in
`game_state_start.hpp` and `game_state_editor.hpp`

```
#ifndef GAME_STATE_START_HPP
#define GAME_STATE_START_HPP

#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include "game_state.hpp"

class GameStateStart : public GameState
{
    private:

    sf::View view;

    public:

    virtual void draw(const float dt);
    virtual void update(const float dt);
    virtual void handleInput();

    GameStateStart(Game* game);
};

#endif /* GAME_STATE_START_HPP */
```

For `GameStateStart` and

```cpp
#ifndef GAME_STATE_EDITOR_HPP
#define GAME_STATE_EDITOR_HPP

#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include "game_state.hpp"

class GameStateEditor : public GameState
{
    private:

    sf::View gameView;
    sf::View guiView;

    public:

    virtual void draw(const float dt);
    virtual void update(const float dt);
    virtual void handleInput();

    GameStateEditor(Game* game);
};

#endif /* GAME_STATE_EDITOR_HPP */
```

For `GameStateEditor`. Most should be pretty clear; we've overridden the
pure virtual functions in the base class, and we've added constructors
that take a pointer to the `Game` that created them (remember in
`GameState` we need such a pointer). We've also added private `sf::View`
variables. A view is a lot like a camera, and the window displays what
all the cameras are seeing. Because we're making a 2D game the world
coordinates will be in pixels, but unlike screen coordinates they are
unbounded! (Whereas screen coordinates may be between 0 and 1024
horizontally and 0 to 768 vertically.) What a view does is look at a
certain section of those world coordinates, and then draws those in a
certain place in the window. We can move the view around, scale it, and
even rotate it, which allows us to change how the player views the world
without changing the world itself. Whilst the default view that
`sf::Window` creates would suffice in our `GameStateStart` class, we're
going to make our own for clarity and consistency, since we'll be making
two in `GameStateEditor`. Why will be explained when we get there.

Now let's make `game_state_start.cpp`. This is a longer file, so we'll
put the source code in sections. First up are the headers and the `draw`
and `update` functions.

```cpp
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include "game_state_start.hpp"
#include "game_state_editor.hpp"
#include "game_state.hpp"

void GameStateStart::draw(const float dt)
{
    this->game->window.setView(this->view);

    this->game->window.clear(sf::Color::Black);
    this->game->window.draw(this->game->background);

    return;
}

void GameStateStart::update(const float dt)
{
}
```

Nothing particularly new here, except for the `setView` and `draw`
calls. `setView` does what it says; it changes the current view that
will be draw to `window` (which we defined in `GameState`). We'll
actually create that view in the constructor, but it will take up the
entire window and everything in this state will be drawn to it. We then
have the `draw` call, which again is an `sf::Window` member function.
See how we're using `game` to get a pointer to that window? We could
just as easily pass the window as an argument to the draw function in
this case, but later on some of the virtual functions will have to have
arguments that we didn't know about when we created the `GameState`
class, and since we can't change the number of arguments in a virtual
function we'll have to use a mechanism like this anyway. Back to the
`draw` call though, what it does is (unsurprisingly) draw its argument
to the window's current view. In this case we're drawing something
called `background`, which doesn't actually exist yet! We will go back
and create it after we finish this state. You can probably guess what it
is though! With those rather boring functions done, we move on to the
more interesting ones; `handleInput` and the constructor

```cpp
void GameStateStart::handleInput()
{
    sf::Event event;

    while(this->game->window.pollEvent(event))
    {
        switch(event.type)
        {
            /* Close the window */
            case sf::Event::Closed:
            {
                game->window.close();
                break;
            }
            /* Resize the window */
            case sf::Event::Resized:
            {
                this->view.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
                this->game->background.setPosition(this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Vector2i(0, 0)));
                this->game->background.setScale(
                    float(event.size.width) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().x),
                    float(event.size.height) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().y));
                break;
            }
            case sf::Event::KeyPressed:
            {
                if(event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Escape) this->game->window.close();
                break;
            }
            default: break;
        }
    }

    return;
}
```

That's a whole lot of SFML code there! We'll start by examining how SFML
processes input. When the user presses a key, moves the mouse, resizes
the window or anything else that is an interaction with the program an
event is triggered. These events store all the information that comes
with the interaction, so a "button is pressed" event will contain which
button has been pressed, and so on. To process these events we must use
the `pollEvent` function, which is once again an `sf::Window` member
function, and which takes a single `sf::Event` as an argument.
`pollEvent` returns `true` whilst there are still events left to
process, and `false` otherwise, so by placing it in a `while` loop we
can process every event in sequence. We then use a `switch` statement on
the type of the event in order to process it.

Here we have three events, a `Closed` event, a `Resized` event, and a
`KeyPressed` event. When we see a `Closed` event we know that the user
is trying to close the window, so we should let them do that by telling
the window to close with the handy `close` function. When we see a
`KeyPressed` event we check to see which key was pressed, and if it was
the escape key we close the window.

Things are somewhat more complex with the `Resized` event. Usually when
a window is resized, the view will continue to look at the same part of
the game world but the window will change its size. This means that what
the user sees will become stretched and distorted as they resize the
window, which is not very visually appealing! To fix this we change the
view so that the number of pixels that the view can see is the same as
the number of pixels the window displays. This way there is a 1:1
relationship between view size and window size and it doesn't become
stretched. That's what we do with the `setSize` function.

![We don't want this!](/tutorial/img/02-02.png)

The problem with expanding the viewing area is that if we have a
background image (`background`) we will quickly see an area of the
screen that the background image does not cover. Because of this we need
to expand the background too. Of course expanding the background has
exactly the same problem as expanding the window, it will become
stretched! This isn't a problem for us though as our background is just
a nice, smooth gradient. If we had an actual picture instead then we
would have to create the picture at a larger size and only show part of
it, or just stop the user from resizing the window (add a third argument
to `window.create` equal to `sf::Style::Titlebar | sf::Style::Close`).

Going back to the background, let's examine that `setPosition` call.
Going from the inside to the outside, we first create an `sf::Vector2i`
object. Unlike an `std::vector<int>`, an `sf::Vector2i` is a
mathematical vector, and in this case a mathematical vector that can
only take integer arguments and that has two dimensions. In other words,
it's just the point `(0, 0)`! But what is that rather long function call
next to it? Well as we said before window coordinates and world
coordinates are different things. A ball placed at the point `(320,
521)` in the game world might be displayed at the point `(220, 421)` in
the window due to our use of views. What the `mapPixelToCoords` function
does is convert a position in window coordinates to its equivalent
position in world coordinates using the current view. By using that
function we ensure that the user always sees the background in the same
place, regardless of how much the view is moved and scaled. Note that
`setPosition` requires an `sf::Vector2f` (which is what
`mapPixelToCoords` returns) and not an `sf::Vector2i` (which is what
`mapPixelToCoords` takes).

Lastly in the `Resized` event we have a `setScale` function called on
the `background`. This just makes sure that the `background` takes up
the entire window like we said before. The scale factor that we use will
be different for each dimension (since the window is not necessarily
scaled evenly) and is equal to the size of the window in that dimension
divided by the size of the image in that dimension. Or to use SFML
speak, the size of the background's texture. We'll discuss exactly what
textures are soon.

```cpp
GameStateStart::GameStateStart(Game* game)
{
    this->game = game;
    sf::Vector2f pos = sf::Vector2f(this->game->window.getSize());
    this->view.setSize(pos);
    pos *= 0.5f;
    this->view.setCenter(pos);
}
```

Lastly we have the constructor, which mostly sets up the view by setting
its size to that of the window (awkwardly `view.setSize` takes an
`sf::Vector2f` as an argument but `window.getSize` returns an
`sf::Vector2i`, hence the typecasts). We then centre the view on the
centre of the window. `sf::Vector2f` and `sf::Vector2i` work just like
mathematical vectors, and so we can multiply them by a scalar (`int`,
`float`, `double`, and so on), and we can add and subtract them
together. If you aren't familiar with vectors, addition and subtraction
is done component-wise, so `(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c,b+d)`, and scalar
multiplication is `a * (b, c) = (a*b, a*c)`. Since the middle is just
halfway along both sides of the window, we multiply the size of the
window by 0.5 to get the coordinates of the centre. Why multiply by 0.5
instead of dividing by 2? No reason, I just prefer multiplication!

Before we move on, we have an important change to make in `main.cpp`

```cpp
#include "game.hpp"
#include "game_state_start.hpp"

int main()
{
    Game game;

    game.pushState(new GameStateStart(&game));
    game.gameLoop();

    return 0;
}
```

First we include `game_state_start.hpp` so we can create a new state,
and then once we've created the `game` we create a new `GameStateStart`
state and push it to the stack, changing the state the `game` is in to
the start state. Remember that we have to use `new` here, and don't fret
about cleaning up the memory, `Game` does that for us. Next let's create
`GameStateEditor`, or at least some of it. We've already created the
header file, so all that's left is to write the source file. Until we
create all of the game logic there isn't too much that we can do.
Regardless, in `game_state_editor.cpp` add

```cpp
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

#include "game_state.hpp"
#include "game_state_editor.hpp"

void GameStateEditor::draw(const float dt)
{
    this->game->window.clear(sf::Color::Black);
    this->game->window.draw(this->game->background);

    return;
}

void GameStateEditor::update(const float dt)
{
    return;
}

void GameStateEditor::handleInput()
{
    sf::Event event;

    while(this->game->window.pollEvent(event))
    {
        switch(event.type)
        {
            /* Close the window */
            case sf::Event::Closed:
            {
                this->game->window.close();
                break;
            }
            /* Resize the window */
            case sf::Event::Resized:
            {
                gameView.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
                guiView.setSize(event.size.width, event.size.height);
                this->game->background.setPosition(this->game->window.mapPixelToCoords(sf::Vector2i(0, 0), this->guiView));
                this->game->background.setScale(
                    float(event.size.width) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().x),
                    float(event.size.height) / float(this->game->background.getTexture()->getSize().y));
                break;
            }
            default: break;
        }
    }

    return;
}

GameStateEditor::GameStateEditor(Game* game)
{
    this->game = game;
    sf::Vector2f pos = sf::Vector2f(this->game->window.getSize());
    this->guiView.setSize(pos);
    this->gameView.setSize(pos);
    pos *= 0.5f;
    this->guiView.setCenter(pos);
    this->gameView.setCenter(pos);
}
```

As you can see this is almost identical to `game_state_start.cpp`, the
only difference being that `GameStateEditor` handles two different
views, and not one. Why does it have two if they're identical? Well
we're going to draw our game world and move around it in this state, but
we'll also want to display information about the city; a HUD,
essentially. We'll want those to stay in the same position regardless of
where we've moved the game camera, and so we'll need two views.  Moving
back to `GameStateStart` we need to add the code to transition from that
state to this one. Declare a private `loadgame` function in the class
definition

```cpp
class GameStateStart : public GameState
{
    private:

    sf::View view;

    void loadgame();

    public:
```

And then define the function in `game_state_start.cpp`

```cpp
void GameStateStart::loadgame()
{
    this->game->pushState(new GameStateEditor(this->game));

    return;
}
```

This is identical code to how we started the game in `main`, but this
time we're creating a new `GameStateEditor` and not a new
`GameStateStart`. Finally we need some way to call the `loadgame`
function. We could do this with a simple spacebar keypress event,
exactly like we did with the escape keypress event

```cpp
case sf::Event::KeyPressed:
{
    if(event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Escape) this->game->window.close();
    else if(event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Space) this->loadgame();
    break;
}
default: break;
```

Sadly the code won't compile just yet, as we haven't defined
`background`, but if you were to comment out those lines then compiling
the program and pressing space should take you to the second state!
It'll be rather hard to tell of course, the only real difference is that
the escape key won't close `GameStateEditor`.
